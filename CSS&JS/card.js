Denis Papin proposed applying this steam pump to the operation of a paddlewheel boat and tried to market his idea in Britain.`,

A 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission released the ISM band for unlicenced use. These frequency bands are the same ones used by equipment such as microwave ovens and are subject to interference. In 1991, NCR Corporation with AT&T Corporation invented the precursor to 802.11, intended for use in cashier systems, under the name WaveLAN. The first version of the 802.11 protocol was released in 1997, and provided up to 2 Mbit/s link speeds. This was updated in 1999 with 802.11b to permit 11 Mbit/s link speeds, and this proved popular.`,
