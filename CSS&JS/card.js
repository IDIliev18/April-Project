        'text':`The first definitive mention of a magnetic compass dates from a Chinese book finished in 1044. It describes how soldiers found their way by using a fish-shaped piece of magnetized iron floating in a bowl of water when the sky was too cloudy
        to see the stars. The compass was invented more than 2000 years ago. The first compasses were made of lodestone, which is a naturally magnetized stone of iron, in Han dynasty China. Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized
        by striking them with a lodestone.`
